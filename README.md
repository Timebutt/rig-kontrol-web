# Rig-Kontrol-Web

This projects offers a browser based driver for Native Instrument's Rig Kontrol 3 hardware controller. As Native Instruments no longer supports this device and the drivers can't be installed on Windows 11 or latest macOS versions, these devices are technically rendered obsolete. The deployed webpage of this repository has an in-browser USB driver that reads from Rig Kontrol 3 and maps button and expression controller commands to a MIDI output device. This in turn allows you to then map those MIDI commands to whatever software you are using and would like to control.
